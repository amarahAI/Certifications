The key to growing in life as a person is to constantly learn and that's what I do every single day be it by reading books, taking up courses or watching YouTube videos, or studying case studies. In this ever-changing industry, your growth can get stagnant or you can quickly become unrelatable if you don't upskill and update yourself and your skills and knowledge.
